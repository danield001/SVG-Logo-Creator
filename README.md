### Testing

Tests have been conducted to ensure that the points of every shape match the expected output. This can be remodelled to suit your needs, whether that be the need for a larger logo etc. Please change the sizing parameters on each shape, and retest the shapes.js file, with the expected matching shape sizes. This will ensure a passing test is present, and all 3 shapes will be output onto the SVG with correct sizing. Please note that text size is set to fit within the stated shape sizes, so please adjust to the respective size.
